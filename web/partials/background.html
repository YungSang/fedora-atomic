      <h3>Packages, Images, and Trees</h3>
      <p>
	Traditional GNU/Linux distributions come as a collection of
	packages, which one can assemble in many ways.  They typically
	target a variety of hardware, offer choices of things like
	filesystems.  A weakness of this model is that there are many
	system configurations which go untested, or nearly so.  It's
	very easy for upgraded systems to diverge from fresh
	installations, due to the way package managers upgrade
	piecemeal.
      </p>
      <p>
	At the other end of the spectrum, systems
	like <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromeOS</a> and 
	<a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a> come pre-assembled,
	and target fixed use cases.  Their update systems reflect this
	targeting - they're not designed to allow much flexibility on
	the client side.</p>
      <p>
	OSTree allows a middle ground - one can
	assemble <i>multiple</i> trees from a variety of packages on a
	build server, <i>naming</i> the resulting filesystem trees
	that are the combination of packages, and then clients can
	reliablly <i>replicate</i> and upgrade.  Furthermore, client
	systems can <i>switch</i> between these pre-assembled trees.
      </p>
      <h3>Short Term Goal - Testing Rawhide</h3>
      <p>
	 The Atomic Initiative will track Fedora Rawhide, assembling
	 packages into filesystem trees, and offering them for atomic
	 replication by both human and machine consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Why machine consumers?  The very same rpm-ostree codebase
	actually
	contains <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/KVM">qemu-kvm</a> based
	testing infrastructure.  It's designed to rapidly <i>boot</i>
	a new updated tree as a virtual guest, running arbitrary
	testing code, and pulling out telemetry such as log files for
	display.
      </p>
      <p>
	Concretely, the <a href="#build-status">build-status</a>
	results are <i>live</i> - the screenshots will change as the
	packages change, automatically.
      </p>
      <h3>Short Term Goal - Testing OSTree</h3>
      <p>
	While the core OSTree codebase is now fairly stable,
	rpm-ostree is undergoing rapid evolution.  It's only recently
	that SELinux is fully enforcing, for example.  The goal is for
	everything to be packaged, and to become a more integrated
	part of the Fedora Infrastructure.
