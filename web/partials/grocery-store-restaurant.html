	    Traditional GNU/Linux distributions come as a collection
	    of packages - this is like a grocery store.  There's an
	    effectively infinite variety of ways one can assemble
	    the parts.  Not all combinations make sense (in fact,
	    very few do), but hopefully none will be actively
	    harmful.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Each time you go to a grocery store (upgrade), you are
	    responsible for reassembling from parts any meals you
	    like.

	  <p>
	    An OSTree repository is more like a restaurant.  You can
	    choose from a number of <strong>pre-assembled</strong>
	    meals (filesystem trees).  But not an infinite variety.
	    Each meal has a <strong>name</strong>, and when you
	    re-visit the restaurant, you can get a newer (and
	    hopefully improved) version of that same meal, or at any
	    time <strong>try a different one</strong>.
	  <p>
	    For Fedora and other operating system vendors, OSTree can
	    act like a restaurant <i>in partnership with</i> a grocery
	    store.  If you like some of the meals, you can take the
	    ingredients and recipies (packages and scripts), and make
	    your own.

	    The analogy isn't as strong here, but traditional
	    image-based systems such as
	    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">ChromeOS</a>
	    and
	    <a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a> are a bit more
	    like a short (or cheap) airplane flight where you have
	    exactly one choice of meal.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Image systems are good in that they fulfill a reliable,
	    targeted purpose.  Additionally of course, many of these
	    kinds of operating systems come with application mechanisms
	    on top.  For ChromeOS, that's web pages.  For CoreOS, it's
	    <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This lets them do quite a bit - but not everything fits
	    cleanly into the "application" or "OS" box.  For example,
	    development headers and tools.  Neither ChromeOS nor
	    CoreOS have an answer for a mechanism to help you develop
	    the system itself.
